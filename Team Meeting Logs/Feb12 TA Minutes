Project Milestone 2: February 19
April 11: Last day to finish projects
April 12 Onwards: Project Presentations

Now: Start working on critical components. Do not focus on styling so much right now

Bad UI is more acceptable than a bad backend

Add user stories to whatever we are creating and the components of our project.

For each minor step of the project, add a user story for proper documentation.

NO recitation next week (Feb. 19) but HTML assignment and Project Milestone 2 still due
