Create a README file with project name, architecture, description, and team members. 
	Make sure to format it https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

Make sure to list any dependencies for your project

Do NOT commit any private infomration in the GitHub

If using an architecture or service that requires a password, make sure to include a way to generate them

Do not need to commit .exe files required to run our program, just list them

For creating diagrams, there are two links under the Week 3 module in Canvas that provide tools to help make them look nice

Keep the GitHub organized (keep milestone stuff in milestones, keep meeting stuff in meetings, etc)
	Create new folders as needed for different topics

Have one person commit the PDF to github and have another commit the README file to keep commit percentages equal

Next step is to start coding the project!
